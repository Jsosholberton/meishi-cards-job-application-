# Technical Test Solution - Frontend Developer

Hello there!

Here's the solution to the technical test for the Frontend Developer position. I've completed all the required functionalities using the specified technologies.

## Project Description

The project consists of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) of cards containing information about vehicles. Each card includes details such as the car's brand, reference, year, and an image of the vehicle. Additionally, a login system has been implemented to protect access to the CRUD view.

## Technologies Used

- **Database**: I used Supabase for data management. Its ease of use and integration with Next.js made it a natural choice.
- **Framework**: I implemented the project using Next.js. Its component-based development approach and server-side rendering capabilities were crucial.
- **Styling**: For styling, I drew inspiration from design models available on Dribble and used TailwindCSS for implementation. This allowed me to create an attractive and responsive user interface efficiently.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install project dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure the necessary environment variables for connection to the Supabase database.
4. Run the project using `npm run dev`.
5. Access the application through the browser using the URL provided by Next.js.

## Additional Features

- **Security**: I implemented an authentication system to protect the CRUD route. Only authenticated users can access the full functionality.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: I designed the user interface with a focus on usability and user experience. The layout of elements and navigation are intuitive and easy to understand.
- **Documentation**: I have properly documented the code to facilitate its understanding and future maintenance. Each component and function is adequately commented.
